# Digital-Clock
A digital clock created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript is an interactive clock that displays the current time in a digital format. The HTML and CSS provide the basic structure and styling of the clock, while the JavaScript handles the functionality of updating the clock in real-time.

The clock typically includes an area for displaying the time, with the hour, minute and second values separated by colons. The time is updated automatically every second using the built-in JavaScript Date() object. Some digital clocks may also include additional features such as 12/24 hour format options, timezone selection, and alarm functions.

Creating a digital clock using HTML, CSS and JavaScript is a great way to practice and showcase your skills in front-end web development. It can be customized and expanded upon to create a more complex clock with additional features, or integrated into other web applications and projects.
